Description: This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. The primary goal is to train a linear regression model to predict the number of passengers based on the month of the year. The steps include loading and preprocessing the dataset, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

Steps Involved
• Download the Dataset: A sample dataset (airtravel.csv) containing monthly air passenger data.
• Import Required Libraries: Libraries used include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
• Load and Explore the Dataset: Load the dataset and explore its structure.
• Preprocess the Data: Convert the categorical feature 'Month' into a numerical format.
• Split the Data: Split the data into training and testing sets.
• Train the Model: Train a linear regression model on the training data.
• Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
• Visualize the Results: Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values.

Dataset
The dataset used is a simple CSV file with the following columns:

• Month: The month of the year (categorical)
• 1958: The number of air passengers in the year 1958 (continuous target variable).

Conclusion
The linear regression model successfully predicts the number of passengers based on the month with a certain level of accuracy. The evaluation metrics (MSE and R-squared) indicate how well the model fits the data. Visualization helps in understanding the relationship between actual and predicted values, showcasing the performance of the model.

Key Findings
• Mean Squared Error (MSE): Indicates the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
• R-squared: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
• Visualization: Provides a graphical representation of how well the model's predictions match the actual data.
• This project demonstrates the fundamental steps involved in building and evaluating a simple linear regression model, providing a foundation for more complex predictive modeling tasks.
